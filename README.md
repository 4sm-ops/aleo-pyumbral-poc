# PoC Overview

We checked Aleo and Umbral documentation and we would like to test 2 scenarios:

1. Umbral key from byte_read of Aleo Private Key SHA256 hash 32 bytes long

![Aleo Umbral Approach #1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4sm-ops/aleo-pyumbral-poc/master/assets/aleo-umbral-approach_1.png)

2. Both Aleo and Umbral keys can be generated from single 32 bytes seed
